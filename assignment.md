 <b>Q1. Identify and explain common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages.</b>      

<br>
<p> Markup is the building blocks to the web, its a form of language code that allows the web to be communicated by code via different types of instructions. Markup is generally used to edit how a web page is appeared via a programing language.

<br>

Each part of the code modifies the end product of the code, so changing something small can change a lot in the long run. 
In web-development the main three 'Markup Languages' are HTML, XML and XHTML. When developing on the web, you would generally use Hypertext markup language 'HTML'. You can customize anything via this language, from visual design, web friendlyness, make interactions simple, or to the more simplicity of how big or small you wanted your text or photos. Whichever way you desire your website to look, HTML is the code for you.</p>

<b>Q2. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
 - packets
 - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
 - routers and routing
 - domains and DNS</b>
 
 
 <br> 
  <b>Packets:</b>
 <br>

 <br>
 Are small bits of data thrown through the internet to communicate with eachother. The network data (packets) are transfered between the Internet Protocols (IP) to give information, e.g emails, websites, etc.

<br>

Packets are like the Auspost of the internet. They have an address were they are going, a message or gift, they have a sender and a reciever, if something goes wrong it comes up with an error. Without packets the internet would have no hope.

<br>
 <b>IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6):</b>

<br>
 An IP address is a identifier for devices or objects connected to the network. Each device has its own unique address consisting of a 32bit binary number, or in IPv4 it would be four eight binary numbers displaying the IP.
 
 <br>
 Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)is a 32bit address  scheme that swaps packets between the link layer network via ethernet. IPv4 is the core protocol for internet traffic. When IPv4 came out, so little people needed it, so it worked smoothly, but as the world has grown the limited 32bit binary code (cap at 4.3 billion) for the IP has run out, thus needing a newer version IPv6.

<br>
So saying that IPv6 is here to cover for the limited space IPv4 had. All of the previous hurdles version 4 had has been updated in 6, including an upgrade from 32bit to 128bit address which now makes the cap at (340quatrillion). IPv4 is a numeric based address system whereas IPv6 is a alphabetic system.
