**Q1. Identify and explain common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages** 

    Markup is the building blocks to the web, its a form of language code that allows the web to be communicated by code via different types of instructions. Markup is generally used to edit how a web page is appeared via a programing language.



    Each part of the code modifies the end product of the code, so changing something small can change a lot in the long run. 
    In web-development the main three 'Markup Languages' are HTML, XML and XHTML. When developing on the web, you would generally use Hypertext markup language 'HTML'. You can customize anything via this language, from visual design, web friendlyness, make interactions simple, or to the more simplicity of how big or small you wanted your text or photos. Whichever way you desire your website to look, HTML is the code for you.<

#### **Q2. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:**
 - packets
 - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
 - routers and routing
 - domains and DNS
 
 
 
 #### **Packets:**


 
    Packets are small little unit of data, A packets is made up of controlled information and data, they're normally 1500 bytes of data each. Inside that data is the sender's IP address and the recievers IP address. These packets are thrown through the internet to communicate with each other to produce information for e.g emails, websites and general internet purposes.
    
    Packets have changes the game for internet developement, because the use of splitting up the controllable data and information into packets has made it incredibly easy to communicate which route it will take and making it way easier to read.


    Packets are like the Auspost of the internet. They have an address were they are going, a message or gift, they have a sender and a reciever, if something goes wrong it comes up with an error. Without packets the internet would have no hope.


 **IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6):**


    An IP address is a identifier for devices or objects connected to the network. Each device has its own unique address consisting of a 32bit binary number, or in IPv4 it would be four eight binary numbers displaying the IP.
 

    Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)is a 32bit address  scheme that swaps packets between the link layer network via ethernet. IPv4 is the core protocol for internet traffic. When IPv4 came out, so little people needed it, so it worked smoothly, but as the world has grown the limited 32bit binary code (cap at 4.3 billion) for the IP has run out, thus needing a newer version IPv6.


    So saying that IPv6 is here to cover for the limited space IPv4 had. All of the previous hurdles version 4 had has been updated in 6, including an upgrade from 32bit to 128bit address which now makes the cap at (340quatrillion). IPv4 is a numeric based address system whereas IPv6 is a alphabetic system.

 #### **Routers and routing:**

    A router is a brilliant piece of technology that sends and receives packets. Routing is method of moving traffic in a network.
 
    Routing is the method of transport for your router to transfer and recieve packets. The routing will always take the most efficient route, if the traffic is busy on the way to your local internet hub, its generally because the routing has taken longer than expected, therefore making it slow.

    A router is constantly running the link state algorithim to figure out which efficient route it has to path to the destination. A link state is home base for the router, and the algorithm is constantly solving the more efficent way through all the other link layers. This algorithm has contributed to the developement to the internet by allowing information and data to be transfered the fasted and most efficient way.
  
#### **Domains and DNS

    A domain name is one of two things, the name of said url 'coderacademy.com.au' and the IP version that the DNS (Domain Name Service) communicates with '255.255.255.0' etc. From the outside in, when viewing a website all you will see is the domain name 'coderacademy.com.au' but in reality its actually being called '255.255.255.0' via the DNS.

    If all domain names were a bunch of numbers, nobody would remember the address to other domains. The domain name allows you to type in 'coderacademy.com.au' and skip the struggle of typing in a bunch of numbers that you'll most likely forget. Everytime you search for a website the DNS keeps track of the IP addresses assosiated with the name, and translates that to the website. This has helped with the developement of the internet by making it easier to search the web with basic website domains.
