celsius = int(input("Insert text here"))

fahrenheit = (celsius*9/5)+32

print(f"The result is: {fahrenheit}.")

# First of all there was no text in the input, so it was asking for nothing in terminal. (This actually doesn't matter but it always helps.)(It will still give an answer.)
# Secondly when asking for a number, 
# should always be putting the input in an integer or float, integar worked fine here.
